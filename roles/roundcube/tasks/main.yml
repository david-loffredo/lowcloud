# Roundcube in a docker container
# https://hub.docker.com/r/roundcube/roundcubemail

# Rather than trying to run apache in the container and secure it
# through https, perhaps we can reverse proxy an outside apache to it
# over localhost:9080 or something.  Bounce apache as normal for the
# certbot renewal, and perhaps bounce the docker-compose to update
# daily at that point.
#

# When run by docker-compose with restart:always, the server comes up
# at boot when the docker service comes up, so we don't have to do
# anything special.

# This key is used to encrypt the users imap password which is stored
# in the session record. For the default cipher method it must be
# exactly 24 characters long.
