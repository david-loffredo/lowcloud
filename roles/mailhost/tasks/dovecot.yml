# Dovecot for local mail delivery and IMAP access.  Do not install the
# dovecot-pop3 package, because we will only use IMAP.

# Saw the following in /var/log, might be a leftover from the default
# install that had 143 enabled.  Only seems to show up once.  dovecot:
# master: Error: systemd listens on port 143, but it's not configured
# in Dovecot. Closing.
