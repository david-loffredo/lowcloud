# included tasks and apply: wasn't added until later.

# For quick reimaging, grab local system data (keys, db).  Afterwards,
# you can use bacula to restore the user data (mail spool).  The when
# rule is needed to restrict to only these explicit tags, otherwise it
# fires on any inherited tags (like 'mail') too.
#
# Unfortunately, the combo of tag/never+when always prints skipped,
# unlike tag/never which is silent unless it fires.  We load this
# dynamically so it just prints skipped for the include_tasks action
# rather than skipped for each task within an import_tasks.
