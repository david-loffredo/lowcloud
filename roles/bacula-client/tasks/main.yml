## restricted backup account with a separate key just to set up the

# This is symbolic name passed by the director to the client that

# variables if something is missing.  See bacula_common for more

# This list could be functionally built but the jinja version in
# ansible does not support the default= argument to map yet.  Just
# build the list procedurally.
