<H1>Updates</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> common, upgrades.yml, logwatch.yml

<p>We set up the unattended upgrades package to install security
patches once a day.  The <code>unattended-upgrades</code> package
installs the updates, the <code>needrestart</code> package bounces
services with changed libraries, and the <code>apt-listchanges</code>
package emails changelogs to the <code>admin_email</code> address.</p>

<p>We configure the <code>logwatch</code> package to send a daily
summary of activity to the <code>admin_email</code> address.  The
report contains basic information about SSH logins, disk usage, mail
traffic, web traffic, and fail2ban activity.</p>

<p>Occasionally a kernel update or other change will require a reboot.
The email report will note this.  Log in and run <code>sudo shutdown
-r now</code> at your convenience.  Patches to postfix or dovecot may
not restart the servers properly, so if you don't see the normal
backula and logwatch messages on a particular morning, you may need to
manually restart them (or just reboot and then run mailboot).</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=os></A>OS Update</H2>

<p>Eventually, the distribution that you are using will fall out of
long term support, and will no longer get security updates.  Debian
versions are typically released every two years, with full support for
three years, and long term support out to five years.  It is wise to
update before your machine  falls out of long term support.</p>

<p>Most distributions have a process for an in-place update to the
next major version.  Instructions can be found online.  I prefer to
use a clean OS install, but this requires a bit of preparation.</p>

<p>Ideally, you have separated your system and data disks onto
different partitions.  Then you can simply replace the system
partition with a fresh OS image, then configure with Ansible as usual.
The small amount of data on the system disk (like certbot keys) can be
handled by the <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> role.</p>

<p>On Linode, I create <code>/dev/sda</code> from an OS image, swap
as <code>/dev/sdb</code>, then create <code>/dev/sdc</code> for a LUKS
encrypted data disk.  Using their online manager, you can delete
the <code>sda</code> system disk, create a new disk from any given OS
image, then use the configuration manager to assign it
to <code>sda</code>.</p>

<p>The general process looks like this:

<PRE class=code>
# system on /dev/sda
# swap on /dev/sdb
# data (plain or crypt) on /dev/sdc

# make snapshot/machine.name directory
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml --tags snapshot

# manually cache anything this missed to the data disk

# REPLACE /dev/sda WITH A NEW OS IMAGE.

# boot and configure the new OS image
$ ansible-playbook -k --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts first.yml
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml

# manually restore anything that needs it
# delete snapshot/machine.name directory
</PRE>

<p>I will typically test out everything on a scrap machine before
updating the live one, There may still be some manual operations when
packages have changed how they do things, like rspamd retiring support
for sqlite.</p>

<p>If you put everything on a single disk, and do not want to in-place
upgrade, you may have to reimage the entire machine and restore from
backup.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=manual></A>Other Manual Updates</H2>

<p>Very rarely, an update may need operator input.  These will be
deferred and you will get a message about it.  To manually install an
update to a package:</p>

<PRE class=code>
% sudo apt update 	     	# fetch latest package index
% sudo apt list --upgradable	# list available upgrades

% sudo apt install &lt;pkg&gt;	# update just foobar pkg
% sudo apt --only-upgrade install &lt;pkg&gt;   # same, won't install new packages
</PRE>

<p>This is specific to Debian and its derivitives.  For Red Hat,
Gentoo, etc. you'll need to figure out how they handle automatic
security updates.</p>
