<H1>Debian 12 Update Notes</H1>

<p>In going from Debian 10 to Debian 12, there are a few notes.</p>

<h2>Journal Logging</h2>

<p>Debian 12 has moved to systemd journals by default and no longer
installs rsyslog.  Consequently, things that examine the logs like
fail2ban and logwatch require some configuration rework.

<p>When updating, I ran into a problem with permissions on the postfix
spool directory and it wasn't starting.  I was suprised that there was
no mail.log in /var/log anymore, but now you use journalctl to get the
logs for everything.  To see the log for postfix, now you do:</p>

<PRE class=code>
% journalctl -u postfix@-.service
</PRE>

<p>You can check service name by bash auto complete. Or view the list
from "systemctl status" command.</p>


<h2>Rspamd and Redis</h2>

<p>Rspamd has moved over completely to redis.  Previously we were
using sqlite to store the classifier statistics.  The stats are under
<code>/var/lib</code> and will be lost when replacing the system disk.
Copy the spam/ham sqlite someplace safe.  They are at:</p>

<PRE class=code>
/var/lib/rspamd/bayes.spam.sqlite
/var/lib/rspamd/bayes.ham.sqlite
/var/lib/rspamd/learn_cache.sqlite
</PRE>

Once you have the new redis-based installation in place, import them
as below:</p>

<PRE class=code>
% rspamadm statconvert --redis-host 127.0.0.1 \
   --spam-db bayes.spam.sqlite --symbol-spam BAYES_SPAM \
   --ham-db bayes.ham.sqlite --symbol-ham BAYES_HAM
   --cache learn_cache.sqlite
</PRE>

<p>Going forward, make sure that the redis database is part of your
backup set.  You can specify <code>redis_dbdir</code> to move it to
your encrypted directory or another backed up location.</p>
