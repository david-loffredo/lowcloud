<H1>LowCloud Mail, Web, and Backup</H1>

<p>These Ansible roles set up mail and web service in the cloud, with
backups from a separate machine.  Requirements are low, with few extra
frills, and should appeal to anyone comfortable with stone knives and
bearskins.  My three goals for this exercise were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Basic mail and web for one or more domains, 
<li>Built securely with modern packages, and proper backups,
<li>A clear description of what is on the machine and why.
</ol>

<p>These Ansible playbooks assume Debian 10 and configure the
following areas. For each one, I describe <em>what</em> is
there, <em>how</em> to configure it, and <em>why</em> I chose it, with
some fun pictures of my old hardware at the bottom of each page.</p>

<p>I hope this can serve as a starting point for your own project.  If
these details don't interest you, a push-button mail server
like <a href="https://github.com/modoboa/modoboa">Modoboa</a>,
<a href="https://mailinabox.email/">mail-in-a-box</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/progmaticltd/homebox">homebox</a> is a
fine alternative.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=start></A>Getting Started</H2>

<p>Check out the <code>lowcloud</code> repo.  Make a separate
directory for your settings by recursively copying
<code>hosts.example</code> to someplace <u>outside</u> of the repo.
We call it <code>myhosts</code> here, but any name is fine.

<PRE class=code>
$ cp -r lowcloud/hosts.example myhosts

$ ls
lowcloud  myhosts
</PRE>

<p>The new <code>myhosts</code> directory contains
a <code>hosts</code> file and a <code>group_vars</code> directory.
After customizing these as described below, I recommend putting this
directory under source control.  You can do that however you like
because it is not connected to the <code>lowcloud</code> repo.

<p>As described in <a href="#extending">Going Further</a>, you can
expand <code>myhosts</code> with your own roles and playbooks, so you
only need to fork <code>lowcloud</code> to change a role in that. It
would be nice to star the <code>lowcloud</code> repo though, so that I
have an sense of how many people find it useful.

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=hosts></A>Hosts</H2>


<p>The <code>myhosts/hosts</code> file
identifies <a href="machines.html">your machines</a>, and organizes
them into groups.  We use two groups: <code>cloud</code>
and <code>backup_server</code>.  The playbooks apply tasks to the
machines in each group.  </p>

<p>Machines are listed by fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and IP
address.  Ansible uses the <code>ansible_host</code> to connect, and
sets the <code>inventory_hostname</code> variable to the FQDN for use
in the scripts.</p>

<PRE class=code>
[cloud]
# mail and webserver, needs a public IP address from a business class
# ISP connection or VPS provider like AWS, Linode, or DigitalOcean
example.com		ansible_host=1.2.3.4

[backup_server]
# connects to other machines to fetch and store backups, best if you
# have physical control of the machine.  It does not need a public IP
# and can be behind a residential ISP connection.
guardian.example.com	ansible_host=5.6.7.8
</PRE>

<p>Once you have machines, <a href="dns.html">create DNS entries for
them</a> using your registrar or other service.  We may eventually run
Bind on the cloud machine, but still getting that sorted out.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>myhosts/group_vars</code> directory contains settings for
the machine groups in the hosts file.  Ansible looks for
a <code>&lt;group-name&gt;.yml</code> file or
a <code>&lt;group-name&gt;/</code> directory containing YML files.
Every machine belongs to the special <code>all</code> group.</p>

<p>Most settings are in <code>all/all.yml</code>.  Look through this
file and customize the values as appropriate.  A few things unique to
each machine are kept in <code>cloud.yml</code>
and <code>backup_server.yml</code>.

<p>Sensitive values like passwords are in
<code>all/vault.yml</code>, which will be an encrypted
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible
vault file</a>.  The <code>vault.yml</code> that you copied is not yet
encrypted and contains placeholders.  Edit it to contain real values,
<a href="ssh.html#keys">generate some ssh keys</a>, then encrypt it
with your own unique password:

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml	# encrypt plain file
</PRE>

<p>The file stays encrypted.  Use the <code>edit</code> command to
open a clear-text version temporarily in <code>$EDITOR</code> to look
at or modify the contents.  You can also change the password
with <code>rekey</code>.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-vault edit vault.yml 		# run EDITOR on file
$ ansible-vault rekey vault.yml		# change password on file
</PRE>

<p>To make it easier to find variables, we prefix each value in 
<code>vault.yml</code> with "vault_" and then declare a version
without the prefix in the other files.  For example, a password might
show up as follows:</p>

<PRE class=code>
something_pw: "{{vault_something_pw}}"   # vault_* is in vault.yml
</PRE>

<p>Ansible vault files are encrypted as AES256 and stored as a block
of ASCII text, similar to ssh keys.  Ansible will decrypt on-the-fly
when running playbooks.  There are many ways to get the password to
Ansible, but we use the <code>--ask-vault-pass</code> flag to type it
in every time.</p>

<p>You shouldn't need anything beyond these files for this
application, but if you extend these playbooks for other things, be
aware
that <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html">Ansible
variables</a> have an absurd amount of flexibility.  Each role also
has settings in <code>&lt;ROLE&gt;/defaults/main.yml</code> that you can override.



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=first></A>First Login Playbook</H2>

<p>The first thing to do after provisioning a machine is run the
<code>first.yml</code> playbook to set up a deployment account,
install keys, and then <a href="ssh.html">lock down SSH</a>.

<p>Tasks are executed remotely as <code>root</code>. The
lowercase <code>-k</code> flag is a shorthand
for <code>--ask-pass</code>.  This is the only time a password-based
login ever happens.  Ansible needs the <code>sshpass</code> package on
your local machine to do password-based login to a remote machine.  If
you can pre-install an ssh key for root, you could use
the <code>--private-key</code> flag instead.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-playbook -k --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts first.yml --limit cloud
$ ansible-playbook -k --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts first.yml --limit backup_server
</PRE>

<p>After this, remote password login is disabled and everything
requires ssh keys.  All further work uses the deployment account.  It
is a good idea to change or star the root password because the
original passed through your VPS provider's UI.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=play></A>Site Setup Playbook</H2>

<p>The <code>site.yml</code> file is the main playbook for our cloud
and backup server machines.  Tasks are executed remotely as
the <code>deploy</code> user, so Ansible needs passwords for the
deploy user (for sudo) and the vault (for decrypting).  The
uppercase <code>-K</code> flag is a shorthand
for <code>--ask-become-pass</code></p>

<p>Ansible playbooks are meant to be idempotent, which means that they
are supposed to leave a machine in a given state, no matter how many
times you run it or what state it was in before.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml
</PRE>

<p>By default, Ansible runs the playbook on all machines in the
inventory file.  We can limit it to a certain group or machine with
the <code>--limit</code> flag.  We can also select just parts of the
playbook with the <code>--tags</code> flag.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# run the playbook only on the cloud group
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml --limit cloud

# run apache tagged tasks only on the cloud group
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml \
    --limit cloud  --tags apache
</PRE>

<p>Most roles have their own tags, so you can call them selectively.
There is another <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> tag that copies
back certain system data like keys and certs for easy transfer when
wiping or migrating a machine.</p>

<p>Adding the <code>--check</code> option does a dry-run that does not
change anything.  This can be combined with the <code>--diff</code>
option to report the actual text changes of templated files.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=extending></A>Going Further</H2>

<p>You can add your own <code>roles</code> directory and playbook YML
files to the <code>myhosts</code> directory and build more extensive
actions into your own setup.  Set your role search path to include the
<code>lowcloud</code> roles to build upon then in your playbook.
Create an <code>ansible.cfg</code> file in <code>myhosts</code> that
contains:

<PRE class=code>
[defaults]
roles_path=../lowcloud/roles
</PRE>

<p>The <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/">Ansible Galaxy site</a>
contains roles that people have written for many different things, and
is a great place to see worked examples and get ideas.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=reboot></A>Rebooting</H2>

<p>At boot, everything will start normally except mail, which waits
until we log in and unlock the encrypted mail spool by running
the <code>mailboot</code> script.  Any incoming mail should remain
queued by the sending system until the mail daemon is up again.</p>
