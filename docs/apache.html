<H1>Web Service</H1>
 
<p><b>ROLE</b> apache

<p>The web service configuration is handled by the "apache" role.
Apache is used as the server and this role sets up SSL keys from Lets
Encrypt using <a href="encrypt.html">certbot</a>.  HTTP and HTTPS are
configured on the standard ports.</p>

<p>The role creates one or more vhosts, along with aliases for each.
The document root for each vhost is
at <code>/var/www/&lt;domain&gt;</code>.  We initialize the root with
an index.html if one is not present.  We create a 'www' user and a
'www-data' group to use when uploading content via rsync.</p>

<P>The default Apache config enables gzip compression, and it is not
recommended to turn it off.  If your website uses cookies, strongly
advise using the SameSite flag to mitigate BREACH (CVE-2013-3587)

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>web_vhosts</code> variable is a list of structs, one for
each root domain, along any other settings.  It looks something like
this.</p>

<PRE class=code>
web_vhosts:
  # simple example.com and www.example.com
  - name: example.com

  # a second domain with more aliases, a different
  # DocumentRoot and a custom error page.
  - name: another.com
    aliases:
      - www.another.com
      - someother.another.com
    root: /var/www/someplace/else
    conf_extra: >-
      ErrorDocument 404 /error/notfound.html
</PRE>

<p>The <code>name</code> is required and is the ServerName.  The
<code>aliases</code> list is optional and contains a list of
ServerAlias values.  If it is not present, it will default to the
'www' alias for the name.  If you don't want any aliases, set this to
an empty list <code>[]</code>.  Other settings are:

<ul>
<li><code>admin</code>: "admin email" (defaults to webmaster@{{name}})
<li><code>root</code> "document root" (defaults to {{webdata_root}}/{{name}})
<li><code>cert</code> "cert file"       (defaults to letsencrypt {{name}}/fullchain.pem)
<li><code>certkey</code> "key file"     (defaults to letsencrypt {{name}}/privkey.pem)
   
<li><code>default</code> (if yes, .conf sorted first to force it as
the default vhost)

<li><code>use_https</code> provide https?  (defaults to True, set to
False for an http-only site)

<li><code>force_https</code> redirect everything to https?  (defaults
to <code>apache_force_https</code> which itself defaults to yes)
</ul>

<p>The <code>certbot</code> role will not request a certificate for a
particular host if the <code>cert</code> or <code>certkey</code>
fields are defined or if <code>use_https</code> is False.</p>

<p>The following can each contain a single string (probably
multi-line) that is included in the http and https configuration
directives.  Use for custom error pages, rewrite rules, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>conf_extra</code> ( both )
<li><code>conf_extra_http</code>     ( only http )
<li><code>conf_extra_https</code> ( only https )
</ul>
<p>You can set the <code>apache_modules</code> variable to force
certain modules to be enabled.  The rewrite module is always present.
By default we always redirect http to https, but if you want to
disable that you can set <code>apache_force_https</code> to no.</p>

<PRE class=code>
apache_modules: [ extra, modules, to, load ]

# permanent redirect from http to https
# apache_force_https: yes
</PRE>

<A NAME=why></A>Why These Packages?</H2>

<p>I really didn't give this much thought.  I've been using Apache for
years and am already familiar with it.  I'm sure that Nginx is also a
fine choice.  Any site of mine is likely to be mostly static HTML,
perhaps a few CGI scripts, and unlikely to spark worldwide interest,
so any server would be fine.</p>

<p>About a year after putting this in place, I was updating my website
and found the <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML 5
Boilerplate</a> project.  This has good recommendations for server
configs that I have incorporated.  The
<a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Observatory/</a> is
also useful for checking your configuration.</p>
