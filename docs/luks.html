<p>Generally, you shoudn't need much beyond the <code>mailboot</code>
script to unlock and mount the partition, but here are a few notes in
case you need to do some things manually.</p>

<p>Actions on the LUKS partition are done with
the <code>cryptsetup</code> tool.  Since you are working with devices,
most of these things need to be run as root.  The base device contains
the ciphertext, the <code>/dev/mapper</code> one is a cleartext block
device, and then you mount a regular filesystem from that.</p>

<p>The <b>luksClose</b> command removes the cleartext block
device <code>/dev/mapper/vault-blk</code>.  You should kill the mail
processes and unmount the regular filesystem <code>/vault</code>
before doing this.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ service postfix stop
$ service dovecot stop
$ service rspamd stop
$ service redis-server stop

$ umount /vault
$ cryptsetup luksClose vault-blk
</PRE>

<p>The <b>luksChangeKey</b> command changes the passphrase on an
encrypted device.  LUKS stores a master key, which is random binary
data that is never seen, in a header block for the device which is
protected by one or more passphrases.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/sdABC
</PRE>

<p>The mailboot script calls <b>luksOpen</b> to create the cleartext,
unlocked device in <code>/dev/mapper</code> where we can then mount
the normal file system.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdABC vault-blk
$ mount /vault
</PRE>

<p>The <code>dmsetup</code> command has many other operations on
encrypted things.</p>

<p>If you want to nuke a LUKS partition, just run wipefs on the
device.  With the header gone, the partition is now useless.  You may
want to back up the header with luksDump.</p>
