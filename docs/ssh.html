<H1>SSH Configuration</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> first

<p>As part of the initial setup of any machine, we lock down access
via SSH, harden it by disabling some weak algorithms, and set up
a <code>deploy</code> user with sudo access that is used instead
of <code>root</code> for administration tasks.</p>

<p>SSH is configured so that all remote access requires a key.
Password-based login is only allowed from the console.  When multiple
people need administrative access to your machines, I recommend
authorizing separate public keys for each person rather than sharing
one private key.  With Ansible, you can easily maintain a list of
authorized keys on all of your machines.</p>

<p>Whether to have a separate deploy account or just use root for
everything is a personal preference.  Having a separate step to
elevate permissions may avoid some accidents, and if a private key is
compromised, an attacker still needs the deploy password to sudo.
Raspberian follows this pattern with the <code>pi</code> account. On
Pi's, we remove the <code>pi</code> account after creating
the <code>deploy</code> one.</p>

<p>We also do some hardening of the SSH server by disabling weak
protocols.  Since encryption is a constantly changing battlefield, I
recommend getting a "yearly Flu shot" by occasionally scanning the
server with tools
like <a href="https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit">ssh-audit</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis">Lynis</a> as discussed in
the <a href="encrypt.html">encryption configuration</a>.</p>

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=keys></A>SSH Keys</H2>

<p>These playbooks expect a SSH keys for the deploy account, the
Bacula tunnel, and the www account for website content.  The tunnel
key should not have a passphrase because it will be used by scripts,
but it is your choice whether to use one for the deploy and www
account keys.</p>

<p>I recommend using
modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA">Ed25519 keys</a>
unless you need to support really old SSH clients.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f deploy -C deploy-yourhost -N ''
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f bacula -C bacula-tunnel-yourhost -N ''
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f www -C www-yourhost -N ''
</PRE>


<p>The public key needs to be in openssh form.  If you happen to use
putty to generate a key, you can convert it as follows.  Install the
<code>putty-utils</code> package and do:</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ puttygen deploy.ppk -O public-openssh -o deploy.pub
$ puttygen deploy.ppk -O private-openssh -o deploy
</PRE>

<A NAME=play></A>Other Notes</H2>

<p>If you happen to change host keys, like when rebuilding a machine,
SSH freaks out with ominous messages about man in the middle attacks.
You can selectively make ssh forget the key for the name and IP using
commands like below.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ssh-keygen -f "/home/foo/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "example.com"
$ ssh-keygen -f "/home/foo/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "11.22.33.44"
</PRE>
