<H1>DNS Configuration</H1>

<p>For the moment I use my registrars DNS service and add records
using their web form.  This is fine, but requires some manual work
when it comes time to advertize DKIM records, since best practice says
they should be rotated periodically.</p>

<p>Eventually we may run bind, make the machine DNS primary for all
domains, then automate DKIM rotation.  Some caution is needed though,
because if the machine is ever compromised, an attacker can publish
bad zones.  DNSSEC would help because we could build and sign zones on
a separate machine, copy to the primary via scp or something, then
regular AXFR out to the secondaries.  If the signing machine is
otherwise inaccessible, an attacker would not be able to modify
anything.  Future work.


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=records></A>Records</H2>

<p>You will need address records for the domain root and the mail
server, and a MX record that points to the mail server. Set the
reverse DNS to point to the mail server address.  When running email
for several virtual domains, pick one as the root, say
mail.example.com, and then have the MX records for the other domains
point to it.

<PRE class=code>
@	IN      A 	11.22.33.44
mail	IN      A 	11.22.33.44

@	IN	MX	10	mail.example.com.

www	IN     CNAME	example.com.
</PRE>

<p>It is not required, but a good idea to add a CAA record that
declares your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization">certificate
authority in DNS</a>.</p>

<PRE class=code>
example.com. CAA 1 issue "letsencrypt.org"
example.com. CAA 1 iodef "mailto:security@example.com"
</PRE>

<p>If you are using DKIM signing, you need a record for each selector
that you are using.  I recommend using a date based selector to make
it simpler to move to a new one.</p>

<PRE class=code>
202002._domainkey IN TXT ( "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=longhexstring" );
</PRE>

<p>Create simple SPF record that says all mail must come from our MX
and to ignore anything else.  Add a DMARC entry that says quarantine
anything that doesn't pass relaxed DKIM or SPF checks.  Note that SPF
records do not cover subdomains, so when sending from a subdomain like
"mail", you should add a record to cover that.</p>

<PRE class=code>
example.com.  IN TXT "v=spf1 mx a -all"
mail.example.com.  IN TXT "v=spf1 mx a -all"
_DMARC.example.com IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com;"
</PRE>

<p>DNS entries can be used to tell mail clients how to configure
themselves, but I'm not sure how many look at this.  This is
documented in RFC 6186. The listings below say use imaps, and that
imap, pop3, and pop3s are not supported.

<PRE class=code>
_imap._tcp     SRV  0 0 0   .
_imaps._tcp    SRV  0 1 993 mail.example.com.
_pop3._tcp     SRV  0 0 0   .
_pop3s._tcp    SRV  0 0 0   .

 _submission._tcp     SRV  0 1 587 mail.example.com.
</PRE>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=secondary></A>Secondaries</H2>


<p>We will probably use Linode's and BuddyNS nameservers as
secondaries.  For Linode, you need to go into their domain manager and
add each domain as a secondary, pointing it to the primary.  Allow
AXFR/IXFR from ns1-ns5.linode.com and add them to your domain's
authoritative nameservers.  Configure notifies for ns1-ns5.linode.com

<p>In order for Linodeâ€™s DNS servers to function as secondaries, your
DNS primary must notify and allow AXFR requests from the following IP
addresses:

<PRE>
    104.237.137.10
    65.19.178.10
    75.127.96.10
    207.192.70.10
    109.74.194.10
    2600:3c00::a
    2600:3c01::a
    2600:3c02::a
    2600:3c03::a
    2a01:7e00::a
</PRE>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=config></A>Configuration</H2>

<p>Linode machines run a network helper at each boot to set up
/etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf for the machine.  It sets
the resolv.conf for the Linode DNS servers, but if we want to use our
own local DNS, we have to turn off that network helper for the
machine.  Then we can can configure theirs as the forward address and
use our local one.

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=propagation></A>Monitor World-Wide Propagation</H2>

<p>DNS propogation may take up to 48 hours. This can be monitored and
checked on <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net">www.whatsmydns.net</a>, 
<a href="https://dnschecker.org">dnschecker.org</a>.</p>



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=dnssec></A>DNSSEC</H2>

<p>I would like to do DNSSEC, but it is difficult to find anyone that
will act as secondary DNS with DNSSEC.  DNSMadeEasy ($30/yr), BuddyNS
($18/mo), and the Bulgarian CloudNS claim to do it, but they do not
even have it configured properly for their own domains.  Google Cloud
DNS and Cloudflare can do DNSSEC, but they generate the keys and do
all of the signing, no AXFR of an already signed zone.</p>

<p>At the moment, the choice seems to be DNSSEC and run your own one
or two servers that could be DDOSed, or none and use broadly available
secondaries.  It also seems that key rotation is a big problem.  Mail
in a box has probably the best setup and even they do not do it
because of the potential for DNS outages.</p>
