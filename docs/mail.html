<H1>Mail Server</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> mailhost

<p>The <code>mailhost</code> role configures a machine as a mail
server.  It receives mail from the outside world and delivers to
mailboxes accessible via IMAP.  We use Postfix for the mail transfer
agent (MTA) and Dovecot as the local delivery agent (LDA) and IMAP
server.  Rspamd is the only milter used, for spam filtering and DKIM
signing.  The <a href="mailnull.html">mailnull</a> role is used on
other machines, like the backup server, to relay mail through the
central server.</p>

<p>All mail is owned by the <code>vmail</code> user and stored in
an <a href="encrypt.html">encrypted directory</a> using maildir
format.  The mail user database, DKIM keys, and other data are kept in
this encrypted location, usually <code>/vault</code>, for privacy.</p>

<p>All accounts are virtual mailboxes described by an SQL database.
Manage this database with the <a href="#mailcfg">mailcfg</a> script.
Background on virtual users can be found
at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html">postfix.org</a>.
Unix accounts are only for system things and no mail is delivered to
them.</p>

<p>We use SQLite for the database because it is small, simple, and
sufficient, but MySQL, Maria, or Postgres can also work.  On Debian,
most postfix daemons described in <code>master.cf</code> run in a
chroot, but the "local" and "virtual" do not, so we can keep the
database in a central location where it is also used by dovecot to
authenticate passwords.</p>

<p>On reboot, postfix and dovecot do not start automatically because
the encrypted directory must first be unlocked.  Log in and run
<code>/usr/sbin/mailboot</code> as root to enter the password, mount
the cleartext directories, and start the mail processes.</p>



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>cryptdir_pw</code> is the password for
the <a href="encrypt.html">encrypted mail spool</a>.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# password for encrypted mail spool
cryptdir_pw: "{{vault_cryptdir_pw}}"
</PRE>

<p>The <code>mail_domains</code> and <code>mail_users</code> lists
give the domains that we should accept mail for and the virtual users
and initial passwords for those users.  

<PRE class=code>
mail_domains:
  - "{{ domain }}"
  - second.example

mail_users:
  - email: "{{ admin_email }}"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_admin_pw}}"
  - email: "relay@{{ domain }}"
    pw: "{{vault_relay_pw}}"
  - email: "user1@{{ domain }}"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_user1_pw}}"
  - email: "user2@second.example"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_user2_pw}}"
</PRE>

<p>Define your mail aliases with the <code>mail_aliases</code> list of
src/dst pairs.  We automatically add aliases to
the <code>admin_email</code> for a list of system addresses for each
domain.  These system aliases include 'root', 'abuse', 'postmaster',
etc. and is given by <code>mail_local_admin_aliases</code>.</p>

<PRE class=code>
mail_aliases: 
   - { src: "source@domain",         dst: "dest@domain" }
</PRE>

<p>If you want DKIM signing, the <code>dkim_selector</code>, usually
following a year month pattern (202001) so that we have a predictable
pattern when we rotate them.  This enables signing and generates the
keys in the <code>dkim_keyroot</code> directory, which defaults to
being under the mail spool.  <b>Add the DNS TXT records found in the
.txt files to the DNS zones</b>, so that people who recieve your mail
can verify that you signed it.</p>

<p>When near rotation time, we can set <code>dkim_selector_next</code>
to pre-generate the keys, but not use them.  This gives us a chance to
get the public keys into DNS and let them propagate.</p>

<PRE class=code>
dkim_selector: 202001
dkim_selector_next:
</PRE>

<p>The <code>mail_server_hostname</code> is what the machine
identifies itself as and where <a href="mailnull.html">client
machines</a> try to relay their mail.  The default value for this is
"mail." on the primary domain.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# defaults to mail+primary domain.
# mail_server_hostname: "mail.{{ domain }}"
</PRE>

<p>The <code>mail_server_hostname</code> is what the machine
identifies itself as and where <a href="mailnull.html">client
machines</a> try to relay their mail.  The default value for this is
"mail." on the primary domain.</p>

<p>Variables can change the location of the mail spool, sieve, dkim,
rspamd, and redis directories to the encrypted location.  Look at the
<code>cloud.yml</code> sample group variables for more information.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=mailclient></A>Mail Clients</H2>

<p>The IMAP and SMTP server for clients
is <code>mail_server_hostname</code>, usually "mail." plus the primary
domain name.  We run IMAP over SSL on port 993, and outgoing mail to
port 587 with STARTTLS and plain password.  The account name is the
entire email address (foo@example.com).

<PRE class=code>
incoming server:	mail.example.com
imaps port:		993
connection security:	SSL/TLS
user name:		somebody@second-domain.example
authentication:		plain password

outgoing server:	mail.example.com
smtp port:		587
connection security:	STARTTLS
user name:		somebody@second-domain.example
authentication:		plain password
</PRE>

<p>We publish a Thunderbird autoconfig XML record on the websites for
each domain, so configuring a new account with that should be
seamless.  This is
under <code>.well-known/autoconfig/mail/config-v1.1.xml</code>.  Other
clients may need manual setup.  The <a href="dns.html">DNS
settings</a> show how to set SRV records, but I'm not sure how many
clients use them.</p>

<p>If a client tries to figure out the settings by hitting the server
with multiple variations, it may trip a fail2ban rule, preventing
further attempts.</p>

<p>You can change user passwords with the <code>mailcfg</code> script,
but users can not currently change them remotely.  Obviously, this
only works if you have a personal connection with your users, but it
can cut out a whole class of password-related mischief.  Feel free to
do something more sophisticated if you need it.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=mailcfg></A>Mailcfg Script</H2>

<p>The <code>mailcfg</code> script is a simple command-line tool to
manipulate the virtual user database.  It is used by the Ansible
playbook to initialize and populate the database.  We install it to
<code>/usr/bin/mailcfg</code> and you must have write access to the
mail database file to use it.</p>

<p>Most people either hand-write SQL queries or install elaborate web
interfaces like postfixadmin to do this job. I didn't care for either
option, so I put together a simple perl script for the common tasks.
It uses DBI, so you can tweak the connect statement and SQL as needed
for other RDBs.</p>

<p>Run it as "mailcfg &lt;command&gt;".  The following commands are
available:</p>

<PRE class=code>
 help		Print this message

 addalias &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;	Adds alias if missing
 adddom &lt;dom&gt;		Add domain if missing
 adduser &lt;email&gt; &lt;pw&gt;	Adds user if missing

 lsalias [&lt;dom&gt;]	List aliases, all or for a domain
 lsdom			List known domain
 lsuser [&lt;dom&gt;]		List users, all or for a domain

 rmalias &lt;src&gt;		Remove alias
 rmalias -id &lt;num&gt;	Remove alias with given id
 rmdom &lt;dom&gt;		Remove domain
 rmuser &lt;email&gt; 	Removes user

 passwd &lt;email&gt; &lt;pw&gt;	Changes user password 
 disable &lt;email&gt;	Marks user as inactive
 enable &lt;email&gt;		Marks user as active
</PRE>



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=rspamd></A>Spam Filtering</H2>

<p>We use <a href="https://rspamd.com/">rspamd</a> to filter spam.
This hooks into postfix as a milter and includes specific rules
similar to SpamAssasin and Bayesean classification similar to the old
Dspam project.  It does both quite quickly.  Because it is run as a
milter, it can reject the very bad spam before it is accepted for
processing.</p>

<p>We use the sieve module under dovecot to deliver messages marked as
spam to the <code>Junk</code> folder.  It trains the Bayes filter on
any good message delivered to the inbox.  We also add IMAP sieve
scripts to retrain the Bayes classifier when mail is dragged into or
out of the Junk folder.  The sieve scripts are near the mail spool in
the location given by the <code>sieve_root</code> variable.  You can
also add your own personal sieve scripts.

<p>the rspamd web console at <code>http://localhost:11334</code> has
statistics and fine-grain controls.  That port is normally blocked and
the server only allows connections from localhost.  Set up an SSH
tunnel to use it.  Either do it from the command line or you can add
the following to the ssh config file for that machine.</p>

<PRE class=code>
LocalForward 11334 localhost:11334
</PRE>

<p>We keep per-user Bayes training data, because everyone has
different opinions on spam.  We do everything during milting and
rspamd picks the first of multiple recipients for the statistics.</p>

<p>It would be better to disable Bayes during milting, then classify
during delivery, when we have one recipient.  However, we should carry
over the score from milting.  I can turn classification on and off
in <code>settings.conf</code>, but haven't figured out how to carry
over the score.  Probably needs to be done in a Lua plugin.  For the
future.</p>

<p>This would also have the nice property that we only reject on
objective criteria found during the milter pass, and can at most
quarantine based on the subjective criteria of the Bayes.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=mailq></A>Managing the Mail Queue</H2>

<p>To inspect and manipulate mail queue, the following commands are
helpful.  You can list and flush the queue as any user, but to delete
you must be root.</p>

<PRE class=code>
List the contents of the mail queue
# mailq

Flush the queue (try to deliver mail)
# postfix flush

Delete everything in the queue
# postsuper -d ALL

Delete only deferred mail, that would otherwise retry later
# postsuper -d ALL deferred

You can also look at a particular message ID in the queue
# postcat -vq XXXXXXXXXX
</PRE>

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=why></A>Why These Packages?</H2>

<p>Back when dinosaurs walked the Earth, there was one mailer, its
name was Sendmail, and it was configured by the black speech of
M4-dor, which I will not utter here.  Lucky people had a leased line,
but most just dialed in couple of times a day and swapped messages via
uucp.</p>

<p>OK, Boomer moment over.  I really <b>do not</b> want to set up a
Sendmail system.  I can, and it still works well, but great options
exist that don't predate the fall of N&uacute;menor.</p>

<p>As of this writing, the top three MTAs by number of servers are
Exim (580k), Postfix (328k), and Sendmail (80k).  That says nothing
about the volume of mail passing through each server, but it does give
an idea of the general level of support.</p>

<p>The default MTA for Debian is exim4, and it is capable.  I did some
tests setting it up as a null client.  Ultimately, I chose Postfix.
It is easy to find documentation for all of the use cases that
interest me, has ample performance, and reasonable configuration
files. It also supports the milter interface introduced by Sendmail,
which is very nice for rejecting spam early in the connection.</p>

<p>Dovecot is the customary choice for Local Delivery Agent and IMAP
server.  It seems like Cyrus and Courier are other possibilities but I
have no familiarity with them.</p>

<p>Rspamd is a relative newcomer to the spam fighting arena but has
made its name by combining the functions of SpamAssassin, Dspam, and
OpenDKIM into one fast package.</p>

<p>The <code>site.yml</code> playbook does not install a webmail, but
if you want one, the <a href="webmail.html">webmail.yml</a> playbook
will install a dockerized Roundcube image on a separate machine.</p>
