<H1>Choosing Your Machines</H1>

<p>These playbooks set up two machines.  Typically, the mail and web
server is in the cloud while backups are done by a machine that you
physically control (old PC in a corner).  I have run the setup with a
$5/mo cloud machine and a <a href="pizero.html">Raspberry Pi Zero</a>
on a shelf.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=mail></A>Mail and Web Server</H2>

<p>A mail and web server needs a public IP address with connectivity
to all ports.  There are two ways to get this: your own hardware with
a business class ISP connection, or someone else's hardware provided
as a Virtual Private Server (VPS) in the cloud.  Residential ISP
connections have a semi-dynamic IP address and block port 25, so they
are unusable for a mail server.</p>

<p>There are many VPS providers.  In the USA, Linode (founded 2003),
Amazon EC2 (launched 2006), Microsoft Azure (launched 2010),
DigitalOcean (founded 2011), or Vultr (founded 2014) are popular
choices.  Amazon and Microsoft charge for CPU, memory, disk, and
network separately, while the others have bundled packages at various
prices.</p>

<p>To deter spammers, most VPS providers block outgoing email traffic
on new accounts.  They will open the ports on request but you'll
usually need to set up proper DNS and then open a support ticket to
let them know that you are running a mail server.</p>

<p>For a simple mail host and static web site, a small (1GB nanode,
t3.micro, Av2 A1, 1GB droplet) host is fine.  You might need something
bigger if you add other services, or a database-heavy dynamic website
like Wordpress.  You can usually migrate to a larger instance later
on.</p>

<p>I use Linode and have found them to be well run and simple.  If you
choose them, it would be nice if you signed up using
<a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=e74c06bee7a764232b36ae63d0cebd3b8287fd4c">my
referral code</a>.  They give me few bucks off my bill if you stick
around for three months.

<p>In any case, once you allocate a machine, verify that the IP
address is not on any of the spam blacklists.  That would be the
internet equivalent of like getting a telephone number that used to
belong to a deadbeat.  Some cloud providers have had more problems
than others in keeping their networks clean.  Many sites like
<a href="https://www.dnsbl.info">https://www.dnsbl.info</a>
can check dozens of lists at once.



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=backup></A>Backup Server</H2>

<p>The backup machine should be something under your physical control,
usually an old machine in your basement.  It connects to other
machines to fetch backups and send outgoing status mail.  Nothing on
the internet needs to find it, so it can live happily behind a
residential ISP connection.</p>

<p>Literally anything that runs Linux will work fine, as long as it
has some disk space for the backup data.  For personal email and some
system files, even a good-sized USB key is probably sufficient.</p>

<p>The playbooks assume that you are using a fresh machine.  If you
use a NAS that is already running other things,
the <code>bacula-director</code> role should be fairly self-contained,
but the <code>common</code> and <code>mailnull</code> roles might
interfere with existing things on the machine.  I see that FreeNAS
advertizes a Bacula plugin, so you might be able to use this role as
the starting point to configure that.</p>
