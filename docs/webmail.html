<p><b>ROLE</b> roundcube, webmail.yml

<p>The <code>webmail.yml</code> top-level playbook configures a
separate machine with a Roundcube instance that uses
your <a href="mail.html">mail server</a>.  We build a Docker image
from the current latest version and set up HTTPS with Letsencrypt
certs and fail2ban checking to prevent brute-force attacks.</p>

<p>The docker-compose files for this are
in <code>/srv/roundcube</code>, and several volumes for the config,
preferences database, and source are mounted there.  Other volumes are
mounted in <code>/var/log</code>. You can rebuild the image at any
time with:

<PRE class=code>
$ cd /srv/roundcube
$ docker-compose down
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
</PRE>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>webmail.yml</code> group vars file holds the webmail
settings.  The <code>webmail_server_name</code> is the machine name
that you are using, and <code>webmail_product_name</code> can be set
to a custom title for the pages.

<PRE class=code>
webmail_server_name: 'webmail.{{ domain }}'
webmail_product_name: My Special Webmail
</PRE>

<p>There are some other settings to configure the firewall, fail2ban,
and certificates but you should not need to change them.  Open up the
managesieve port on your mail server firewall by adding 'sieve' to the
firewall services in the cloud.yml group settings</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=why></A>Why These Packages?</H2>

<p>I did not plan to install a webmail package, or any other PHP-based
application, but it turns out that Chromebooks do not have a built-in
IMAP client.  There are ways to install one, but this may not be an
option in certain situations.</p>

<p>Roundcube is a solid choice and probably the most popular open
source webmail.  It seems to have twice as many active developers and
addresses issues quicker than Rainloop.  The new reactive UI is a big
improvement over the previous layout, although as of this writing, it
is still too new for the Debian backports.</p>

<p>Since I wanted the latest version, I decided to just use the Docker
image published by the project.  Running it in a container is also a
nice way to limit any damage from possible PHP exploits.  It was my
first experience with Docker and I was quite impressed at having a
basic image running in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>Getting the firewall and fail2ban working properly took a bit more
effort though.  We had been doing simple filtering on the INPUT chain,
and needed to <a href="firewall.html#docker">reorganize our rules to
protect docker containers</a>.  We also needed to make some changes in
the docker image to expose the logs so that we could scan them with
fail2ban.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, I was very impressed with Docker, and will
happily use it again.</p>
