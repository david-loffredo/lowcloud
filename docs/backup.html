<H1>Backup</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> bacula-client, bacula-director

<p>We use <a href="https://www.bacula.org/">Bacula</a> to manage
backups.  This usually runs on at least two machines.  Each machine to
be backed up includes the <code>bacula-client</code> role, and a
separate machine initiates and stores the backup data.  This is
configured by the <code>bacula-director</code> role.</p>

<p>The client and director communicate over several ports.  Since the
client is in the cloud and our director is usually NATed and behind a
firewall, we leave those ports blocked on both.  When it is time for a
backup, the director sets up an ssh tunnel for the ports.  We use a
restricted backup account with a separate ssh key to set up the
tunnel, as described in
the <a href="https://wiki.bacula.org/doku.php?id=sshtunnel">Bacula
wiki</a>.  We can back up a mix of many machines, some needing a
tunnel (like a cloud machine) and some that can directly connect (like
a local PC).</p>

<p>We back up user data like the mail spool and document roots for the
web sites, as well as system data like certs, DKIM keys, and so forth.
The <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> tag is another way to make a
short-term copy of the system data.  Is it worth it to back up logs?

<p>Bacula has several processes that run, usually spread over at least
two machines, and they are configured by the following files
in <code>/etc/bacula</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>bacula-fd.conf</code> - File daemon on each client machine.
Authorizes one or more directors to contact it.

<li><code>bacula-dir.conf</code> - The director on the backup server
machine.  Defines all of the client machines to contact, what to get
from each, and where to put it, and the scheduling.  Also configures
an SQL database to use for cataloging all of the files across all of
the clients.   Usually there is only one director.

<li><code>bacula-ds.conf</code> - Storage daemon, usually on the
backup server machine but could be elsewhere.  Defines storage devices
like disk or tape and authorizes one or more directors to contact it.

<li><code>bconsole.conf</code> - Console, for talking with a director
for status or to restore files.  This defines the director to talk to.
</ul>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The director uses a database for the catalog of files and jobs.
Postgres is the default, but MySQL and Sqlite3 are also available.
Postgres and MySQL need a password but Sqlite does not.  The next
three passwords for authenticate the director to the client, storage,
and console processes and are usually given long (50-60char) random
strings of letters and numbers.  The ssh tunnel that Bacula uses
requires a public and private keyfile.

<PRE class=code>
bacula_db: <em>pgsql / mysql / sqlite3</em>
bacula_db_pw: changeme  

bacula_client_pw:  "{{ vault_bacula_client_pw }}"
bacula_storage_pw: "{{ vault_bacula_storage_pw }}"
bacula_console_pw: "{{ vault_bacula_console_pw }}"

bacula_tunnel_sshpub:   "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/tunnel.auth') }}"
bacula_tunnel_sshkeypath: ~/.ssh/tunnel.key

# put the backups where you prefer.
bacula_storage_datadir: /backup/bacula
</PRE>

<p>The client does not need many settings.
The <code>bacula_client_fileset</code> variable describes the
directories you want backed up.  There are many knobs other knobs to
play with if you want to do something fancy.</p>

<p>This defines the behavior for the client, but the fileset
data <b>LIVES ON THE DIRECTOR</b>.  When changed, you must refresh the
director, not the client.</p>

<PRE class=code>
bacula_client_fileset:
  include:
    - /etc/letsencrypt
    - "{{mail_db_root}}"
    - "{{mail_dkim_root}}"
    - "{{mail_spool_root}}"
    - "{{webdata_root}}"
</PRE>

<p>If you have detailed knowledge of Bacula, you can add
<code>options</code> and <code>exclude</code> entries to
the <code>bacula_client_fileset</code> dictionary.  These translate to
the equivalent Bacula FileSet sub-blocks.  You can also include
a <code>freeform</code> entry with raw text for your own jobs and
filesets.

<p>If a client does not need an ssh tunnel,
set <code>bacula_client_tunnel</code> to false in variables <em>for
that client</em>.  You can have some clients with a tunnel and others
without.  Without a tunnel, the Bacula ports on director and client
need to be open so they can contact each other - add 'bacula' to
<code>firewall_services</code> list.  
 
<PRE class=code>
# Set to no if a client does not need an SSH tunnel.   
#bacula_client_tunnel: no
#firewall_services: ['ssh', 'other things', 'bacula']
</PRE>

<p>Creating these roles forced a deeper understanding of Ansible
variables.  Most roles need settings for just one machine at a time.
The Bacula roles need settings over a network of machines, like each
client of a director.  Defaults makes it even more interesting.
The <code>bacula-dflts</code> role is used by the client and director
roles to coordinate these settings.  The source files for that role
contain more discussion on defaults and hostvars.

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=using></A>Using Bacula</H2>

<p>Backups are usually automatic, and an status email will be sent to
the admin account when they are done.  All other interaction is done
on the director machine using the Bacula console <code>bconsole</code>.

<p>I recommend firing up the console and getting familiar with it
before you need to.  Try to manually run a backup ("run") and try to
restore some files ("restore").  The Bacula manual has
a <a href="https://www.bacula.org/9.4.x-manuals/en/main/Restore_Command.html">nice
walkthrough</a> of the restore process.

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=why></A>Why Bacula?</H2>

<p>We do backups so that we can recover to a prior "known good" state.
Two reasons we might need that:
<OL>
<li>Hardware problem, accidental deletion, or other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error#PEBKAC">PEBKAC</a>
situation.</li>
<li>Someone has exploited the machine.</li>
</OL>

<p>Initially I planed to
use <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> because it is
simple to configure, has nice features like deduplication &amp;
encryption, and a good community.  It stores data on local disk or
over SSH to a server like
by <a href="https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html">rsync.net</a>.
Borg won't go to an S3 bucket, but a similar project called
<a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> will.</p>

<p>Once I thought more deeply about <em>who</em> could access the
backups, I changed my mind.  For a disk crash or mistake, any backup
software is fine.  All of them can provide a recent copy of any
damaged files so you can get your machine back to normal.

<p>The second scenario &mdash; a p0wned machine &mdash; is trickier.
If you find yourself in this situation, you should not trust anything
that the attacker had access to and, after figuring out how they got
in, you should probably rebuild the machine from scratch.  Happily,
with everything in an Ansible playbook, this is not as big a job as it
used to be.

<p>Borg and Restic work locally on the machine, and can access past
backups for pruning, etc.  Once an attacker is on the machine, they
can mess with the backups too.  Borg has an append-only mode for this,
but it just queues deletions until a trusted machine touches the
backups.  This makes any automatic pruning of old backups, even from a
trusted machine, dangerous unless you are sure nothing was
compromised.

<p>So after considering all of these factors, I returned to Bacula,
which is slightly more complex to configure, but handles both restore
scenarios, scales to as many machines as you want, and has all storage
options, including tape (which Borg thinks no longer exists).  It
requires setting up more than one machine, but you can keep your
Bacula director and storage on a machine that you physically control,
with minimal access to the outside world.  Even a $10 Raspberry Pi
Zero sitting on a shelf can back up a personal email/web server.</p>
