<p>When talking about encryption, people usually distinguish between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_in_transit">data in
transit</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest">data at rest</a>.
To protect data in transit, we encrypt communication links for mail
(STARTTLS and IMAPS) and web (HTTPS).  To give the other party
confidence that we are who we claim to be, we identify ourself using
certificates issued by <a href="#certbot">Certbot /
LetsEncrypt</a>.</p>

<p>To protect data at rest, we place sensitive data like the mail
spool, DKIM keys, and mail user database into
a <a href="#cryptdir">central encrypted directory</a>.  When the
machine is rebooted, everything starts normally except mail.  We must
ssh in and run the <code>mailboot</code> script and type in the
encryption password to unlock the directories and start the mail
daemon.  Any incoming mail should remain queued by the sending system
until the mail daemon is up again.</p>

<p>Keeping the communication secure is an ongoing effort, as various
protocols are strengthened and deprecated in response to ever more
clever attacks.  The <a href="https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/">mozilla
ssl-config generator</a> is an ideal first step for any configuration.
Tools like <a href="https://testssl.sh/">testssl.sh</a> and sites like
<a href="https://www.immuniweb.com/">immuniweb.com</a> are also useful
for periodically scanning for new vulnerabilities.  The
<a href="https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit">ssh-audit</a> script
looks for weaknesses in the <a href="ssh.html">SSH setup</a>,
this <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">ssllabs test looks at
https</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis">Lynis</a>
test many different aspects of a system.</p>

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=certbot></A>Certbot / LetsEncrypt</H2>

<p><b>ROLE</b> certbot

<p>We use certbot to acquire LetsEncrypt SSL certificates.  We request
one certificate for each web domain and one for the mail server, to
simplify moving web or mail across machines as needed.  Each
certificate matches any aliases for that domain (www., etc). We use
the http challenge and run certbot standalone, manually starting and
stopping any web server.</p>

<p>The <code>/etc/letsencrypt</code> directory holds a history of all
past keys under the <code>archive</code> directory and symlinks to the
current one under the <code>live</code> directory.  These are mode 700
so only apps that run as root can see them.  This works for apache,
postfix and dovecot, but if a non-root app needs access, you might
want to create a ssl-cert group and change it to mode 750.</p>

<p>Below is an example of certs for the example.com and foobar.com
domains.  When archiving the letsencrypt directory, it is important to
use a method that preserves the symlinks in the live directory or
certbot may not renew properly.  <a href="backup.html">Bacula</a>
preserves the links and the <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> tag
makes a compressed tar file of this directory.</p>

<p>Certificate renewal is done by cron and any firewall or web server
handling is done by small shell scripts in the <code>pre</code>
and <code>post</code> directories under <code>renewal-hooks</code>.
Services that need to bounce when certificates change are reloaded by
scripts in the <code>deploy</code> directory.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=certbot_vars></A>Certbot Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>certbot_certs</code> variable contains a list of records
describing the certificates that we should request.  Each record
includes a list of domains and aliases and an optional email.  By
default, this includes records for each website plus any extras.</p>

<PRE class=code>
certbot_certs: '{{ certbot_vhost_certs + certbot_extra_certs }}'
</PRE>

<p>An individual record looks like:

<PRE class=code>
 - domains: [ maindom, aliasdom1, aliasdom2 ]
   email: 'addr' (optional, default admin_email)
</PRE>

<p>The <code>certbot_vhost_certs</code> is built from
the <code>name</code> and <code>aliases</code> fields in
each <code>web_vhost</code> entry.  The
<code>certbot_mail_certs</code> variable has one record for
<code>mail_server_hostname</code>.  To have separate certs for your
mail server and webservers, just set the extra certs variable as
follows.

<PRE class=code>
certbot_extra_certs: '{{ certbot_mail_certs }}'
</PRE>

<p>We run certbot standalone and use renewal hooks to temporarily take
control of the web ports.  The <code>certbot_service_stop</code>
variable lists any web server to stop while renewing.  If the machine
normally blocks the http/https ports,
setting <code>certbot_open_firewall</code> to true adds a temporary
iptables rule to allow them.

<p>The <code>certbot_service_reload</code> list contains services that
need to have 'reload' called on them if the renewal process changes
any certificates.

<PRE class=code>
# Set to yes only if web ports are normally blocked
# certbot_open_firewall: no

# stop/start these during the challenge response period
certbot_service_stop:
  - apache2

# also reload these when we get a new cert.
certbot_service_reload:
  - postfix
  - dovecot
</PRE>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=cryptdir></A>Disk Encryption</H2>

<p><b>ROLE</b> cryptdir

<p>We create one directory for all data encrypted at rest.  The
encryption technology can be LUKS, EncFS, or none.  With none, this
role does no encryption.</p>

<p>We keep the mail spool, mail user database, DKIM keys, and sieve
files in this directory.  The mail queue is in there when using LUKS
(EncFS probably won't work with the sockets in the postfix chroot).
Web data is not there because that is public information and we want
the web server to come up at boot.</p>

<p>At boot, everything starts normally except mail, which waits until
we log in and unlock the encrypted directory with
the <code>mailboot</code> script.  Any incoming mail should remain
queued by the sending system until the mail daemon is up again.  The
backup server can use the same technique to encrypt the bacula pools.
See <code>backup_server.yml</code> in the group settings for more
details.</p>

<p>LUKS encrypts a separate disk partition at the block level, then
mounts it as a cleartext block device through the mapper.  The
cleartext device contains a plain Ext4 filesystem and is mounted
normally.  <a href="luks.html">Some LUKS notes</a>. </p>

<p>With EncFS, a separate directory contains individually encrypted
files and is mounted loopback as cleartext through FUSE.  EncFS can be
used anywhere, but it is rather outdated, as is eCryptfs.  Useful if
you are not in a position to allocate a separate partition.</p>

<p>EncFS works at the file level, so it is not entirely transparent.
When using it for the mail spool, Dovecot had problems with "Error:
Couldn't create mailbox list lock file_create_locked() failed".
Changing the <b>lock_method</b> to "dotlock" instead of the default
(fcntl) fixed the issue, but block-level encryption avoids this sort
of thing.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=cryptdir_vars></A>Disk Encryption Variables</H2>

<p>You must set the password, usually through the
<code>vault_cryptdir_pw</code> value in the hosts.example.
Set <code>cryptdir_type</code> to 'encfs', 'luks', or 'none' to change
the technology.  The default is EncFS and does not need any other
settings.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# EncFS encryption, no other settings needed.
# Data in /vault, ciphertext version in /vault_crypt
</PRE>

<p>
With LUKS, you must set <code>cryptdir_luks_dev</code> to the
partition for your encrypted data. LUKS encryption <b>completely
overwrites that partition</b>, so make sure that you don't have
anything important there!</p>

<PRE class=code>
# LUKS encryption, must specify partition
# Data in /vault
# Cleartext block device /dev/mapper/vault-blk
# Ciphertext block device /dev/replace-with-real-device

cryptdir_type: luks
cryptdir_luks_dev: "/dev/replace-with-real-device"
</PRE>

<p>You can turn off encryption if you have reasons.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# None, /vault unencrypted
cryptdir_type: none
</PRE>

<p>The name of the central directory is given
by <code>cryptdir_root</code>.  This defaults to <code>/vault</code>.
If you want to use this for a different machine, you can customize the
mounting script that it generates with the boot script and boot
services variables.  The settings below are what the mailhost role
uses.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# mailboot script generated by the cryptdir role
cryptdir_boot_script: "{{mail_cfg_dir}}/mailboot"
cryptdir_boot_services:
  - postfix
  - dovecot
  - redis-server
  - rspamd
</PRE>



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=why></A>Why These Packages?</H2>

<p>Any cert can enable encrypted communication, even a self-signed
one, but only a cert from a trusted certificate authority (CA) makes a
statement about your identity.  LetsEncrypt is the baseline that
states that you control a particular domain.  Other paid options can
be used if you need a stronger declaration of identity.  For simple
HTTPS and IMAPS, LetsEncrypt is fine.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">virtual
private server</a> (VPS) is convenient but never as private as your
own machine.  The cloud company has full access to the hardware and
disk resources, and with physical access, a whole spectrum of attacks
become possible.  Even then, as Ken Thompson pointed out
in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210">Reflections
On Trusting Trust</a>, unless you wrote the code yourself, on hardware
that you built yourself, there is always room for mischief.</p>

<p>We encrypt the mail spool and other private things, which protects
against a rogue employee in the data center, but probably not a nation
state.  </p>

<p>The encryption method depends on your situation.  If you can create
partitions, use LUKS, otherwise EncFS.  If you have physical control
of your server, you might choose 'none'.  Another possibility is
per-directory ext4 encryption with fscrypt.  I don't have much
experience with that, but it might do a better job than EncFS without
needing a separate partition.</p>
