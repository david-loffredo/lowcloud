<H1>Firewall</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> common, firewall.yml

<p>We implement firewall rules directly using <code>iptables</code>,
with <code>iptables-persistent</code> to reload the configuration on
boot.  The IPv4 and IPv6 rules are in
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and <code>rules.v6</code>.  These
files are well commented and explain the purpose of each rule.</p>

<p>The IPv4 and IPv6 rules protect normal applications and those in
Docker containers.  We only allow incoming connections to ports that
were explicitly opened.  We always open the ssh port.  We also allow
pings, but rate limit them, and drop unusually-formed packets.</p>

<p>We run <code>fail2ban</code> to scan the logs for repeated
intrusion attempts and temporarily ban IPs.  We use a fairly
aggressive setting which may trip when trying to configure mail
clients.  You may want to use the <code>fail2ban-client</code> tool to
check the jails if you are having trouble connecting.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>Open ports for new services by adding the symbolic name to
the <code>firewall_services</code> list.  It recongizes 'ssh', 'mail',
'sieve', 'web', 'dns', and 'bacula'.  You define your own names for
services by defining variables
<code>firewall_opentcp_&lt;name&gt;</code> and/or
<code>firewall_openudp_&lt;name&gt;</code> as a list of port numbers.
It doesn't matter if port numbers are repeated across services.</p>

<PRE class=code>
firewall_services: [ 'ssh' ]

# Define 'foobar' name for firewall services by defining:
#firewall_opentcp_foobar: [ 12345, 23456 ]
#firewall_openudp_foobar: [ 34567 ]
</PRE>

<p>The <code>firewall_opentcp</code> and <code>firewall_openudp</code>
variables are just lists of extra ports that will be opened.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# will append ports from the mnemonic list of services but can be
# initialized with extra ports.
firewall_opentcp: []
firewall_openudp: []
</PRE>

<p>If you want to drop all connections from certain IPs, or allow all
connections from others, add them to the following lists.</p>
  
<PRE class=code>
# Friendly networks that should be ignored by fail2ban, and allowed
# through the firewall
firewall_allow_ips: []
firewall_allow_ips_v6: []
firewall_block_ips: []
firewall_block_ips_v6: []
</PRE>

<p>The <code>fail2ban</code> jails are usually controlled by the
firewall services names.  Names like "ssh", "mail", "sieve", or "web"
are expanded to a list of hashes describing the jails for that
service. Each jail hash has a "name" that should be enabled, plus any
other key/value pairs that should appear in the jail config as "key =
value".  The list of jails for a named service is given by
a <code>fail2ban_jail_&lt;svc&gt;</code> variable.</p>

<PRE class=code>
fail2ban_jails: '{{ firewall_services }}'

# ssh jails always added
fail2ban_jail_ssh:
  - name: sshd
    mode: aggressive
  - name: pam-generic
    banaction: iptables-allports

fail2ban_jail_mail:
  - name: dovecot
  - name: postfix
  - name: postfix-sasl

fail2ban_jail_sieve:
  - name: sieve

fail2ban_jail_web:
  - name: apache-auth
  - name: apache-overflows
</PRE>

<p>The firewall services list is used by default, but you can
set <code>fail2ban_jails</code> to a different list of strings and
hashes.  Add custom jails or override a built-in definition with a
hash with the same name towards the end of the list.</p>

<p>The example below has the built-in ssh jails (always present), the
mail jails, an apache jail that operates on the DOCKER-USER chain, and
overides the built-in sshd jail definition with a very long ban.</p>

<PRE class=code>
fail2ban_jails:
  - mail
  - name: apache-auth
    chain: DOCKER-USER
  - name: sshd
    mode: aggressive
    bantime: 1000years
</PRE>

<p>You can also customize the default find and ban times with
the <code>fail2ban_findtime</code> and <code>fail2ban_bantime</code>
variables.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# These are the defaults values
# fail2ban_findtime: 2h
# fail2ban_bantime: 24h
</PRE>

<p>Debian 12+ now use systemd journals by default and no longer
generate log files.  The configurations for things that examine the
logs like fail2ban and logwatch have been adjusted, but if you are
working on a machine that still uses files, change the following
variable to no.

<PRE class=code>
# System logs can be in files or the systemd journal.  Debian 12+
# default to the journal, while older distros still use files and
# rsyslog.
use_journalctl: yes
</PRE>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=docker></A>Docker</H2>

<p>Network traffic to software in Docker containers is handled
differently than traffic to software running natively on the machine.
Docker creates small virtual LANs to connect containers within the
machine.  Traffic going to a Docker container is then routed to this
virtual LAN through the iptables FORWARD chain, while traffic going to
native software is handled by the INPUT chain.</p>

<p>These chains are in the default "filter" table, in the center of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables#/media/File:Netfilter-packet-flow.svg">this
sprawling diagram of the netfilter packet flow</a>.  Unfortunately,
most people add their firewall rules to the INPUT chain, which has no
effect on FORWARD traffic to Docker containers.  There are reams of
bad and misleading advice on the net about combining firewalls and
Docker, but the solution is simple, do not use the "filter" table.</p>

<p>We do most blocking on the PREROUTING chain of the "mangle" table.
Packets go through this chain early in the processing, which has two
big benefits.  First, it covers both INPUT to native apps and FORWARD
to Docker containers.  Second, the earlier you can drop a bad packet,
the more bad packets you can handle.</p>

<p>We do need some accommodations for Docker.  In particular, when
using fail2ban for a container, we must make sure that it can find the
logs for the container and put its rules on the DOCKER-USER chain.
You can find an example of this
in <code>group_vars/webmail.yml</code>. </p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=why></A>Why These Packages?</H2>

<p>The <code>ufw</code> (universal firewall) package is a popular
choice for blocking everything except for a few ports, and it has a
convenient Ansible module.  It is nice for manually opening and
closing ports, but it is just a wrapper around <code>iptables</code>
and <code>iptables-save</code> files.</p>

<p>I generated <code>iptables-save</code> files directly because it
gives a much clearer picture of the complete state of the rules, while
UFW mostly just gets in the way if you want to use ipsets or work with
the sophisticated rules set up by Docker.  The iptables syntax is easy
enough to understand once you've seen a few rules.</p>

<p>A second reason was idempotency.  UFW keeps its
own <code>iptables-save</code> files, so a port stays open until you
explicitly tell UFW to close it.  With Ansible, we list open ports, so
when you remove a port from the list, you may intend it to be closed,
but it remains open on the machine until you tell UFW to close it.  By
generating the rules.v4 and rules.v6 ourselves, we guarantee a known
state.</p>

<p>It seems like some people are moving to nftables (nft) instead of
iptables.  Something to keep an eye on for the future.</p>

<p>The <code>fail2ban</code> package does not stop attacks, merely
reduces the rate at which they can occur.  This helps with brute force
attacks on a password-protected service like IMAP, and provides some
noise control for the logs.  The version in Debian 10 is fairly recent
so we use it stock.  The Debian 9 version was old, so we previously
added some custom patterns for ssh.</p>
