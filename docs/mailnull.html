<H1>Mail Relay from Client Machines</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> mailnull

<p>The <code>mailnull</code> role configures a machine as a <em>null
client</em> - any outgoing mail from system jobs like cron or bacula
is relayed to the central mailhost and no local delivery is done.  We
use Postfix for the null client too.</p>

<p>The mail server is configured to always accept mail from the local
host, specific whitelisted IP addresses, and from clients that
authorize using a user name and password (user agents like Thunderbird
or phones).  Everything else is subjected to the full battery of
tests.</p>

<p>Historically, you whitelist the local network block so that other
machines at your site can submit mail from system things like cron
jobs.  The other machines on site are configured as null clients to
relay all mail through the central mailserver.  This can also work if
your machines are spread among the cloud, as long as they have fixed
IP addresses known ahead of time.</p>

<p>In the case of machines behind an ISP with changable IPs, or for
machines come or go with an unpredictable IP, we need a different
approach.  Those machines still relay all mail, but when they connect,
they authorize with a special "relay" account, so they can be treated
like a normal user agent.  We would like to configure the mail server
to only accept mail for local addresses when authenticated with this
account, but postfix only restricts based on the FROM, not the AUTH
(you can force the two to match, but that does not help us much)</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The only variables that needs to be configured for the null client
is the relay account password as <code>vault_mail_relay_pw</code> in
an Ansible vault .  The relay account, host and port can also be set,
but the defaults are usually fine.  The default values are shown
below:</p>

<PRE class=code>
# Relay all mail through a smarthost with authentication using the
# given account and password.

mail_relay_acct:   "relay@{{ domain }}"
mail_relay_pw:     "{{vault_mail_relay_pw}}"

mail_relay_host:   "{{ mail_server_hostname }}"
mail_relay_port:   587
